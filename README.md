# DarkComet-RAT
Remote Administration Trojan
DarkComet is a remote access trojan (RAT) developed by Jean-Pierre Lesueur (known as DarkCoderSc),
an independent programmer and computer security coder from France. Although the RAT was developed back in 2008, 
it began to proliferate at the start of 2012. The program was discontinued, 
partially due to its use in the Syrian civil war to monitor activists but also due to its author's fear of being arrested for unnamed reasons.
As of August 2018, the program's development "has ceased indefinitely", 
and downloads are no longer offered on its official website
